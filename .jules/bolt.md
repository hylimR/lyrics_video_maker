## 2025-05-22 - [Iced GUI Performance] **Learning:** The `view` function in Iced is called on every state update, including high-frequency `Tick` events (60fps) for playback. Reconstructing large lists (like 500+ lyric lines) in `view` creates significant widget allocation overhead every frame, even if the list content hasn't changed. **Action:** Use `iced::widget::lazy` with a pointer-based comparison wrapper (like `DocumentRef` using `Arc::ptr_eq`) for expensive widget trees dependent on large immutable-ish data structures.

## 2025-05-22 - [Build Environment] **Learning:** `skia-bindings` build script triggers a segmentation fault in `clang++` 18 when processing GCC 13 headers (specifically `string_view` UTF-8 validation errors). This blocks native compilation on environments with this toolchain combination. **Action:** When verifying Iced applications in such environments, rely on code analysis or attempt WASM targets if feasible (though `klyric-renderer`'s WASM path also needed maintenance).
